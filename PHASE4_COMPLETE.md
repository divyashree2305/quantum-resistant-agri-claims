# Phase 4: AI Fraud Detection Module - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Phase 4 of the Post-Quantum Secure Insurance Claim System has been implemented. The AI fraud detection module provides pluggable fraud scoring with flexible feature extraction and automatic integration with the tamper-evident logging system from Phase 3.

## Completed Components

### 1. AI Module Structure (`ai/`) ✅

**Directory Structure:**
```
ai/
├── __init__.py               # Package initialization
├── ai_score.py              # Main scoring module ✅
├── config.py                # Model configuration ✅
└── fraud_model.pkl          # Pre-trained model (placeholder provided)
```

### 2. Model Configuration (`ai/config.py`) ✅

**Features:**
- Model metadata configuration
- Expected features list for flexible extraction
- Model type specification (isolation_forest, xgboost, etc.)
- Model version tracking

**Configuration:**
```python
MODEL_CONFIG = {
    "model_path": "ai/fraud_model.pkl",
    "model_version": "model_v1",
    "model_type": "isolation_forest",
}

EXPECTED_FEATURES = [
    "claim_amount",
    "time_of_day",
    "location_risk",
    "claim_type",
    "claimant_history",
    "previous_claims",
    "claim_age_days",
    "damage_severity"
]
```

### 3. Scoring Module (`ai/ai_score.py`) ✅

**ModelLoader Class (Singleton):**
- Loads model once at startup for performance
- Caches model instance across multiple calls
- Error handling for missing or invalid model files

**Key Functions:**

**extract_features(claim_data: dict)**
- Flexible feature extraction from claim data
- Adapts to available fields in claim_data
- Fills missing features with sensible defaults
- Extracts time-based features from timestamps
- Returns (feature_vector, feature_dict) tuple

**score_claim(claim_data: dict)**
- Loads model using singleton pattern
- Extracts features with flexible approach
- Computes SHA3-256 feature hash for audit trail
- Predicts fraud score based on model type
- Returns structured result with metadata

**score_and_log_claim(claim_id: str, claim_data: dict)**
- Scores claim for fraud likelihood
- Automatically logs to tamper-evident log
- Returns result with log_entry_id
- Creates complete audit trail for model predictions

**Model Type Support:**
- Isolation Forest: Converts anomaly scores to [0, 1] fraud likelihood
- XGBoost: Direct probability scores
- Other models: Generic prediction support

### 4. Integration with Tamper-Evident Logging ✅

**Automatic Logging:**
- All fraud scores logged to Phase 3 append_log
- Feature hashes enable input verification
- Model version tracking for audit trail
- Log entry IDs returned for reference

**Integration Points:**
- Uses `append_log.add_log_event()` from Phase 3
- Uses `crypto.hash_data()` from Phase 1
- Creates complete audit trail for model predictions
- Feature hashes ensure integrity of scoring inputs

### 5. Testing Infrastructure (`tests/test_ai_fraud.py`) ✅

**Test Coverage:**
- ModelLoader singleton pattern verification
- Feature extraction with complete data
- Feature extraction with missing data (defaults)
- Feature extraction with timestamp parsing
- Fraud scoring with mock model
- Feature hash consistency verification
- Integration with tamper-evident logging
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Test model creation for validation

**Test Results:**

## Key Features

### 1. Flexible Feature Extraction
- Adapts to available fields in claim_data
- Fills missing features with defaults
- Extracts time-based features from timestamps
- Converts categorical to numeric as needed

### 2. Singleton Model Loading
- Loads model once at startup
- Caches model instance for performance
- Reduces I/O overhead
- Thread-safe implementation

### 3. Feature Hashing for Audit Trail
- SHA3-256 hashing of feature values
- Enables verification of model inputs
- Tamper-evident tracking
- Consistent hashing for reproducibility

### 4. Automatic Logging Integration
- All scores logged to Phase 3 tamper-evident log
- Complete audit trail for model predictions
- Feature hashes for input verification
- Model version tracking

### 5. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing features
- Model loading errors raise RuntimeError
- Invalid inputs handled appropriately
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Integration Points

### With Phase 3 (Tamper-Evident Logging)
- Uses `append_log.add_log_event()` to log all fraud scores
- Creates audit trail for model predictions
- Feature hashes enable verification of scoring inputs
- Log entry IDs for reference

### With Phase 1 (Crypto)
- Uses `crypto.hash_data()` for feature hashing
- SHA3-256 ensures consistent, tamper-evident feature tracking
- Cryptographic integrity for model predictions

### With Future Phase 5 (API)
- `score_and_log_claim()` will be called by claim submission endpoint
- Returns structured result for API responses
- Automatic logging requires no API-layer code
- Complete fraud detection integration

## Usage Example

```python
from ai.ai_score import score_and_log_claim

# Score and automatically log
result = score_and_log_claim(
    claim_id="CLAIM-12345",
    claim_data={
        "claim_amount": 50000,
        "time_of_day": 23,
        "location_risk": 0.8,
        "claim_type": "theft"
    }
)

print(f"Fraud score: {result['score']}")
print(f"Model version: {result['model_version']}")
print(f"Logged as entry: {result['log_entry_id']}")
print(f"Feature hash: {result['feature_hash']}")
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Features extracted flexibly from claim data
- ✅ Fraud scores computed correctly
- ✅ Feature hashing provides audit trail
- ✅ Automatic logging to tamper-evident log works
- ✅ Error handling graceful (raises exceptions)
